Multiple Monitor Wallpaper

The command 'xrandr' provides details regarding each monitor
and the positions of the display areas relative to each other.

The total area spanned by all monitors is reported as a "Screen":
----
Screen 0: minimum 16 x 16, current 3840 x 1160, maximum 32767 x 32767
----

In this case the total current size is 3840x1160.
SCREENX=3840
SCREENY=1160

We want to determine the position of each display device within this
screen area, and also where the blank rectangles are located. There
are generally two cases: side-by-side, or upper-and-lower.

When rendering the wallpaper image, we will add blank regions
above/below each of the side-by-side images, then combine the two
resulting images left/right.

In the case of upper-and-lower, we will add blank regions to the
left/right of images, then combine the two resulting images top/bottom.

The active monitors are shown as 'connected' in the xrandr report,
whereas other display inputs are show as 'disconnected'. We are only
interested in the connected devices.

----
XWAYLAND0 connected primary 1920x1080+1920+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 600mm x 340mm
----
XWAYLAND1 connected 1920x1080+0+80 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 530mm x 300mm
----

D0XSIZE=1920
D0YSIZE=1080
D0XOFFS=1920
D0YOFFS=0

D1XSIZE=1920
D1YSIZE=1080
D1XOFFS=0
D1YOFFS=80

In this example you can see the displays are side-by-side. That's
because the offset of the first display is equal to the size of
the second display:

D0XOFFS == D1XSIZE  (1920 == 1920)

The second display is offset below the first display (80 pixels).
Subtracting out the display regions from the screen, we get the
blank regions:

D1XSIZE x D1YOFFS + D1XOFFS + D0YOFFS
D0XSIZE x D1YOFFS + D1XSIZE + D0YSIZE
1920 x 80 + 0 + 0  (Above the second display, left of the first)
1920 x 80 + 1920 + 1080  (Below the first display, right of the second)
